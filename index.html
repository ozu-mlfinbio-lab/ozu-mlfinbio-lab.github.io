    <p> OzU Machine Learning in Finance and Bioinformatics Lab is a research lab in the Faculty of
    Engineering at Özyeğin University in Istanbul, Turkey. We focus on
    developing Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods for problems
    within Finance and Bioinformatics. We are especially interested in
    graph and time-series based modeling. </p>

        <h3>Machine Learning in Finance</h3>
        <p> This field is a relatively new interdisciplinary field, where machine
      learning techniques are used to analyze and predict different
      markets, including but not limited to stocks, options, cryptocurrencies.</p>

        <h3>Bioinformatics</h3>
        <p> Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field of science
      that develops methods and software tools for understanding
      biological data, especially when the data sets are large and
      complex. The subsequent process of analyzing and interpreting data
      is referred to as computational biology. In our lab, we especially focus on developing
      machine learning and optimization-based techniques for those
      problems. </p>

        <h3>Graph Machine Learning</h3>
	<p> Graph Machine Learning (GML) is the application of machine
      learning to graphs specifically for predictive and prescriptive
      tasks. GML has a variety of use cases across supply chain, fraud
      detection, recommendations, customer 360, drug discovery, and
      more. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are gaining attention for Graph
	Machine Learning problems. </p>
